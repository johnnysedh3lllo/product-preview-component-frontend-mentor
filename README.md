## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned
the objective of this project was to get and experience with a real life workflow situation. i learnt how to use CSS Variables to a reasonable degree.


### Continued development
in later projects i would like to focus on utilizing CSS Grid more to become more fluent with it as well as understanding the right units to use in certain scenerios. also focusing on more responsive design layouts.
